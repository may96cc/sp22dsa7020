    "## Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistic measures help us draw inferences about larger population from sample data. \n",
    "You rarely have access to full population datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following: \n",
    "The evidence linking cigarette smoking and lung disease is almost irrefutable. \n",
    "Based upon this information, what proportion of Americans have given up smoking? \n",
    "One way to answer this question would be to survey the entire population of the United States. \n",
    "It would be impossible from the standpoint of time and cost-effectiveness. \n",
    "Mathematicians have created methods of estimating population parameters from samples drawn from target populations that adequately represent the larger population. \n",
    "\n",
    "In inferential statistics we will be answering questions or testing hypotheses about populations based upon samples or prior data. \n",
    "Since parameters of populations are generally not available we must rely on sampling techniques to estimate them."

    "### Sampling Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling distribution represents the distribution of a sample statistic considering all possible samples of a particular size that could come from a given population.  Put another way, a sampling distribution is the frequency distribution of a statistic \n",
    "over many random samples from a single population.  A _statistic_ is a numeric description of the sample, while a _parameter_ is a numeric description of the popluation.  We use sample _statistics_ to estimate population _parameters_.  \n",
    "We know that there will be some error involved when we attempt to relate those sample statistics to population parameters.  This error term can be estimated and is used in inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, how do we know the average height of males in this country is 5'9\"? If we were to draw one hundred different samples of 10 males at random, we would find a certain amount of variability among the means and standard deviations of the different samples.  The _standard error of the mean_ is defined as the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean. In other words, if you take many random samples from a population, the standard error of the mean is the standard deviation of the different sample means. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a researcher asserts something about a population using the information from a sample, this is called an inference.  The researcher makes this inference with the knowledge that there will be some descrepency and thus the possibility that their inference may be mistaken. A _Significance level_ reflects a \"tolerance level\" with the likelihood of making an incorrect inference.  Some researchers conclude that if the event would occur by chance 5% of time or less, then the event could be attributed to non-chance factors.  In other settings, researchers conclude that if the event would occur by chance 1% of time or less, then the event could be attributed to non-chance factors. These are the 0.05 and 0.01 significance levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem/data domain and other factors drive the required significance levels for a particular statistical evaluation."

    "#### Example \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of male heights, we could choose at random 10 males and their average height would fall 69\" $\\pm$ 2.25\"(1.96) -- in other words, 64.59 to 73.41.  \n",
    "The sample standard deviation is multiplied by 1.96 since a z-score of $\\pm$1.96 would encompasses 95% of the normal distribution. \n",
    "Here if we are using 0.05 significance level we would theoretically be correct 95% of the time. \n",
    "Also, we would know that 5% of the samples we chose would have a mean height of greater than 73.41\" or less than 64.59.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\alpha = 0.05$ significance level is associated with a 95% confidence interval.  (The confidence level = 1 - $\\alpha$ and is usually expressed as a percentage.)  A confidence interval gives a range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter.  This interval is only exact when the population from which the sample is drawn follows a normal distribution. For large samples from other population distributions, the interval is approximately correct, due to the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform inferential statistics or parametric tests of significance, \n",
    "we'll have to use sampling distributions. \n",
    "In order to create a sampling distribution we would need to draw all possible samples of size n from a given population. \n",
    "Once we have calculated the mean for each distribution the resulting distribution of these means would represent the sampling distribution of means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling distributions have 3 characteristics:\n",
    "* The mean of the sampling distribution will not change with a change in sample size. If the mean from the sampling distribution of means is 20 when n=10, it will remain 20 whether you increase or decrease the size of the samples. Simply put, **the mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the population**.\n",
    "* As the sample size in the sampling distribution of means increases, the dispersion of sample means decreases. The larger the n, the more compact the distribution of sample means. As n increases, standard error of the mean decreases.\n",
    "* If the sampling distribution of means is taken from a normally distributed population, the sample means will also be bell shaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above three characteristics, the **Central Limit Theorem** states:  \n",
    "If random samples of fixed size n are drawn from any population, as n becomes larger, \n",
    "the distribution of sample means approaches normality with the overall mean approaching $\\mu$  (i.e., the population mean).\n",
    "The standard error of the sample means is equal to\n",
