    "Previously, we tried to analyze data using different kinds of visualizations. \n",
    "Graphs are easy to understand and catchy when you want to explain something. \n",
    "You can convey lot of information through a picture. \n",
    "However, as we saw, there is a limit to the extent of information you can show on the graph and still convey its meaning appropriately. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen graphs do a great job in univariate and bivariate data analysis. \n",
    "They did fine in explaining how data varies in four dimensions by plotting 3-dimensional data \n",
    "points and using color as a fourth feature. \n",
    "However, it is hard to plot 5 features within a single plot. \n",
    "Even if you manage to plot 5 dimensions it will be difficult to interpret the graph. \n",
    "So when you have multidimensional data, which can reach 1000's of features, \n",
    "you have to rely on multivariate statistics for analyzing the data before you explore visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, statistics will help you to narrow down the list of significant features you can use for building a model. \n",
    "These reduced sets of features can be analyzed using graphs. \n",
    "Statistics will guide which features or data to visualize to gain more insights from the data."
